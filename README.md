# kt_yacht : Implement GTA:O Yachts in FiveM

This plugin/addon or whatever you call it is a work in progress, it will not have any effect on your players/server so use it on your own risk.

It is based on the great research of @Starystars67 - https://github.com/Starystars67/FiveM-Galaxy-Super-Yacht, I'm just working or at least trying to finish it.
LUA is not my thing so any suggestions for optimizations are welcome.
